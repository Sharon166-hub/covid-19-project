# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing global COVID-19 data by tracking key metrics such as total cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations. The goal is to gain insights into trends over time, compare countries' responses, and visualize data with charts and maps.

## Project Objectives:
- Collect and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or compatible environment)
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `numpy`

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data).

### To run the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `covid_analysis.ipynb` to see the analysis.

## Optional Features:
- User input for country selection and date range.
- Choropleth map visualization of COVID-19 cases by country.

## Insights and Reporting:
The notebook provides a summary of findings, trends, and key insights based on the analysis of COVID-19 data across multiple countries.
